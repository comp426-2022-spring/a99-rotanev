# a99 Final Project - Carolina Calories

## Overview

Carolina Calories is an app designed to help users keep track of how many calories in their meals.

## Inspiration

Globally, malnutrition is constantly prevalant. In 2018, "821 million people suffered from hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition globally" [(Source)](https://sph.umich.edu/pursuit/2019posts/malnutrition-in-humanitarian-crises.html#:~:text=More%20than%20821%20million%20people,and%20malnutrition%20globally%20in%202018.&text=Malnutrition%20is%20characterized%20by%20deficiencies,general%20undernutrition%2C%20or%20general%20overnutrition.&text=In%20cases%20of%20disasters%2C%20we%20focus%20on%20undernutrition%20and%20nutrient%20deficits.). 

Inspired by this public health crisis, we decided to create a calorie counter so users can keep track of how many calories they are eating in a day.
