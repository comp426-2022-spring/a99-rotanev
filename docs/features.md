## Features

* **_(can we add info about login here)_**
* Users can enter the name of the food and how many calories it was. The app will not accept invalid values for the calorie amount.
* Once a user enters the food item, it will be added to a list. This list can be sorted by ascending of descending calorie amounts using the drop-down menu.
* Individual items from the list can be deleted. Furthermore, the entire list can be cleared by using the "Delete All" button.
* As one would expect, the total amount of calories is calculated from all of the items in the list. This value is updated anytime a new food is added to the list.
* Finally, when the page is refreshed, the data is saved for the user to return to.
